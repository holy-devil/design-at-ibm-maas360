            <h1 class="head-title">My work at IBM Security MaaS360</h1>
            <p class="about-content">Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at IBM Security MaaS360 - an enterprise endpoint management solution.<br/>
            The solution enables enterprises to manage corporate data on their company and employee owned devices. The product is deployed and operated by IT teams of organisation to manage productivity and security on their corporate devices.
            <br/><br/>
            At IBM, I lead design and modernisation efforts for MaaS360 admin portal, which can be broken down into following:</p>
             ‚ñ´Ô∏è research, design and support the development of new features and projects<br/>
             ‚ñ´Ô∏è design owner for multiple strategic projects<br/>
             ‚ñ´Ô∏è lead NPS and WalkMe analysis to gather customer painpoints<br/>
             ‚ñ´Ô∏è plan and prioritise modernisation projects for design roadmap<br/>
             ‚ñ´Ô∏è co-ordinate design operations for MaaS360<br/>
            <br/><br/>
            <p class="about-content">I have been working on long term as well as small short term projects. Since the long term projects are under development, I can only summarise them here. For details, you can contact me further.
            </p>
          <br/><br/>
          
          <h2 class="head-title">Policy modernisation</h2>
          <p class="about-content">Policy is the most critical feature of MaaS360, and also the most complex and time consuming. Admin can define and push settings to enrolled devices based on company‚Äôs security and productivity policies.<br/><br/>
          IT admins, our main users, spend ~10 min while configuring a policy, and have many pain points with this workflow - foremost it being information heavy and causing analysis paralysis.
          <br/><br/>
          Aim was to modernise the policy workflow so admin can ‚Ä®- configure and publish the new policy settings within 5 minutes* (if admin know what they want)
          <br/><br/>
          This was the first modernisation projects proposed in modernisation roadmap by me, and now is in beta phase of development.
          </p>
          <br/><br/>

          <h2 class="head-title">Security dashboard</h2>
          <p class="about-content">Increased remote working üè° , growing use of mobile devices üì± for work 
          has increased number of risks and threats üëæ to corporate data on employee devices. Costs of remediating threats are huge üí∞, and hence endpoint management solutions are become integral part to secure these devices.
          <br/><br/>
          Current product's does have some sort of security monitoring through compliance rules and homepage, but this is still very fragmented and mixed with productivity. IT admin's dont have a clear picture of their org's risk trend or user behaviour trend leading to risks.
          <br/><br/>
          Aim was to give a holistic view on organisation‚Äôs security posture of managed users and devices.
          <br/><br/>
          There were two similar projects in security domain being run by two different teams - which were seeming to create conflicting overlaps. Hence, this project was hatched by me to have a common security panel for IT admins, which will cover all usecases from both projects in conflict. 
          <br/><br/>
          The first phase of this view is going GA soon, while I continue to work on the ideal view based on new framework developments and possibilities.
